 1.  I identified some coins that have been going up for n days if you'd like to check them out.

Based on that suggest few coins to invest in.
Rinse and repeat every 24 hrs or longer for lower risk.

## TODO: Improve the risk assessment node. Give it tools to do more complex risk research for each coin.
